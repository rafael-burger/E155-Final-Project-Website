# Volumetric Display

Website documenting volumetric display built by Rafael Burger and Tjaard Van Loben Sels. The volumetric display works by method of rotating an array of LEDs such that the LEDs trace out a cylindrical volume. The active LEDs are updated 64 times during each rotation, which the form 64 radial slices of the produced 3-dimensional image.
