# Project Abstract
![cube_image](./assets/img/IMG_1737.jpg)

This website presents the ENGR-155 project completed by Rafael Burger and Tjaard Van LÃ¶ben Sels. This project, inspired by [EvImnKey's similar project](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/lmtdf9/this_is_my_take_at_a_hologram_for_my_bachelors/), aimed to provide a platform for displaying three-dimensional images. To achieve this effect, a two-dimensional array of LEDs was spun quickly along its long axis such that the plane of LEDs traced out a cylindrical volume. This LED array was then updated at many steps during each rotation to generate the desired image.
