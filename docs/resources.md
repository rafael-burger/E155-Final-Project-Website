# References

The working principle of our design was inspired by the [work of EvImnKey](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/lmtdf9/this_is_my_take_at_a_hologram_for_my_bachelors/) who posted on reddit the results of his use of a rotating light-plane for volumetric display. 

This [slide deck](https://www.st.com/resource/en/product_training/stm32l4_peripheral_touchsense.pdf) provided by STM was useful in understanding the STM32 touch sensing controller and the principles of charge transfer acquisition. 

# Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge the following members of the HMC community: 

- Professors Joshua Brake and Tina Smilkstein for their support throughout the design process
- Sam Abdelmuati for allowing us to scavenge so excessively from the stockroom
- Kaitlin Lucio for suggesting we use a LED array-based trigger signal to prevent drift over time
- All the classmates whose presence made all the late nights in the digital lab a little less dreadful.
